# GraphicsAPI
 The Graphics API is a scene graph API for OpenGL 1.1. The graph library allows programmers to create 3D scenes by constructing a data structure that represents the content of the scene. The API defines the classes that are used to create the data structure. In addition to the library, it includes several example programs that demonstrate its capabilities.
